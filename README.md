# PokeProject

This project is one that was my original project after my training.  It was jointly made with a coworker.

This app allows the user to choose two Pokémon and do a single turn 'battle simulation' with them, providing the user with the Pokémons' stats and movesets, by pulling information from the pokeApi.  Not actively maintained
